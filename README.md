# C-for-control-system
Using C++ for controlling a motor and vice using arduino uno

So the aim was:
-design a semi-automatic motorized bench vice
-fabricate
-test

Problem statement;
It was observed that the bench vice is one of the most used tools in a workshop.
The vice takes a reasonable amount of energy to operate especially when handling heavy objects.
This physical exersion is rough and can take a toll on the operator in intensive labour periods and over extended periods of use.

Specific objective was to design a semi-automated bench vice that the operator will only push a button to clamp or release a workpiece.
We followed to design the electrical system that utilizes various components to automate parts of the process;
These include:
- Limit switches
- Hall sensor
- Arduino uno
- CNC shield
- Nema 17 for prototype stage
- A4988 motor driver
